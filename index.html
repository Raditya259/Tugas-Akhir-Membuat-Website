                    War Thunder is a multiplayer vehicle combat video game
                    developed and published by Gaijin Entertaiment. Announced in
                    2011, it was first released in November 2012 as an open beta
                    and officially released in January 2013. In this article, I
                    will share the updates for vehicles in War Thunder.

                        The Leopard 2 PSO, with PSO standing for “Peace Support
                        Operations”, was KMW proactive development of the
                        Bundeswehrs requirements for a tank that needed to be
                        adapted for urban warfare peacekeeping operations. As a
                        result of this version, the Leopard 2 PSO features a
                        compact Euro-Powerpack engine, and has been equipped
                        with optional equipment, capable of being fitted for
                        whatever mission is at hand. The Leopard 2 PSO hull has
                        been equipped with additional armor modules on the sides
                        and on the turret, as well as reinforced underbody
                        protection. The modernization of Leopard 2 tanks under
                        the PSO program was first delayed and then eventually
                        abandoned in favor of upgrading tanks to the Leopard 2A7
                        specification.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Specifically designed for urban combat environments, the
                        Leopard 2 PSO features additional modules of armor that
                        have been added to the sides of the hull and turret —
                        which are typically the most vulnerable areas of the
                        Leopards armor layout. Thanks to the addition of this
                        extra protection, the Leopard 2 PSO will now have
                        increased survivability against shaped charge rounds, as
                        well as hits against autocannon fire. These additional
                        armor modules can also improve protection against
                        kinetic shells fired from other MBTs, but typically
                        kinetic shells will have no problem against this extra
                        protection!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moving onto a more obvious part of the Leopard 2 PSO,
                        which is the large dozer blade that is located at the
                        front. The purpose of this dozer blade was to clear any
                        obstructions that the tank may face, and in the game,
                        will be able to move terrain around on the map — the
                        same as any other dozer blade. It also gives additional
                        protection, especially against shaped charged shells and
                        guided missiles!
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Furthermore, in addition to new armor, the Leopard 2 PSO
                        received a Euro-Powerpack engine and a new transmission.
                        This has been added to help with the weight of the
                        additional added armor, and despite its higher HP, you
                        will not notice any improvements to the speed compared
                        to previous Leopard 2 versions. As for ammunition that
                        can be fired, the Leopard 2 PSO features a new, exciting
                        DM11 high-explosive shell to play with. And, as with
                        previous Leopard 2 variants that you are familiar with,
                        the Leopard 2 PSO features excellent shells and
                        firepower, a laser rangefinder, as well as thermal
                        imaging for the commander and gunner.

                    <ul>
                        <li>8 weapon hardpoints.</li>

                        <li>Improved engine.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        In the early 1990s, the first single-seat F-16C appeared
                        which was upgraded under the Block 50 program. This new
                        program saw the installation of a new General Electric
                        F110-GE-129 bypass engine, which featured increased
                        thrust when taking off and at low speeds, as well as a
                        new radar and updated avionics so that advanced weapons
                        could be used. F-16C Block 50s are still in service
                        today with the US, as well as foreign operators such as
                        Turkey and Greece
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Courtesy of the Block 50 modernization program, the
                        F-16C is equipped with a brand new F110-GE-129 engine,
                        which in comparison to the well known F-16A, means the
                        F-16C will have an increase in thrust in static and
                        lower speeds. Furthermore, when approaching the speed of
                        sound, the thrust increase is proportional to the
                        overall mass of the F-16C. Because of this, while at
                        transonic and supersonic speeds, the performance of the
                        F-16C is equal to or just slightly superior to the F-16A
                        Block 15.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Moving onto what weaponry this further developed F-16C
                        has to offer. Thanks to 8 weapon hardpoints and a new
                        radar, the F-16C will ensure that you will have the best
                        weapons at your disposal. For air-to-air missiles, the
                        F-16C can carry the AIM-7 Sparrow air-to-air missile as
                        well as AIM-9L Sidewinders. In addition to this, the
                        F-16C can also carry conventional unguided weapons that
                        can be used against ground targets, which include
                        free-fall retarded bombs, incendiary bombs as well as
                        rockets — there is certainly plenty to choose from!
                        There are also exciting new laser-guided bombs, which
                        are currently not featured on F-16s in the game, thanks
                        to the addition of the LITENING II targeting pod.
                        Previous F-16 pilots will be glad to know that this
                        means two types of bombs — the GBU-12 Paveway II and
                        GBU-24 Paveway III — weighing 500 and 2,000 pounds
                        respectively, will be able to be carried on the F-16C.
                        Moreover, the F-16C can also carry AGM-65D Maverick
                        missiles, which are launched from a triple-rail pod.

                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        The vehicle was first unveiled in its lighter KF31
                        configuration in June 2016 at the Eurosatory exhibition.
                        This debut was soon followed by the heavier KF41
                        variant, unveiled at the same event in 2018. By 2020,
                        Rheinmetall had entered negotiations with several
                        potential operators, including Australia, the Czech
                        Republic, and the United States. Hungary became the
                        KF41's first official operator in September of that
                        year, placing an order for 218 vehicles.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The KF41 comes equipped with a 30 mm MK 30-2/ABM
                        autocannon, which some tank commanders may already
                        recognize from the German Puma IFV. Infamous for its
                        deadly ballistics and steady rate of fire, the MK 30-2
                        is a versatile weapon, capable of punching through enemy
                        MBTs at close to medium distances but also downing
                        hostile aircraft with the right ammunition loaded. Apart
                        from the autocannon, the KF41 is also fitted with a
                        Spike-LR missile launcher. As a result of the missile
                        armament, the KF41 anti-tank capabilities are boosted
                        even further, being able to knock out even heavily
                        armored opponents at long engagement distances with its
                        tandem warhead ATGMs. Rounding off the KF41 arsenal is a
                        pair of machine guns, mounted coaxially as well as one
                        mounted in a remote-controlled turret on the roof.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While heavily armed, the KF41 still retains signature
                        characteristics of an IFV. Mobility is impressive, being
                        able to reach speeds of 75 km/h under ideal conditions.
                        Additionally, with a high power-to-weight ratio the KF41
                        can not only accelerate very quickly, but it can also
                        navigate treacherous terrain with ease. As a result,
                        commanders can easily perform flanking maneuvers or
                        relocate at a moments notice if ground is being lost to
                        the enemy.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Despite being an IFV, the KF41 features some serious
                        protection which most of its opponents should pay close
                        attention to. While the steel armor itself may only
                        suffice for stopping autocannons and shrapnel from
                        damaging the vehicle, its additional Rheinmetall ADS
                        active protection system can effectively destroy
                        incoming missiles. This coupled with the vehicles
                        excellent additional features which include RWR and high
                        quality thermal vision, significantly increase the odds
                        of the KF41 surviving an attack which was not initiated
                        by itself.
